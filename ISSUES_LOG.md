## [2025-06-03] Issue: Web Search Integration for Diamond Family Assistant

**Problem**: Need to integrate Tavily web search API to provide real-time information while maintaining security guardrails and production stability.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive web search tool with multi-layered security:

### ‚úÖ Implementation Details:

1. **Created `src/tools/web_search_tool.py`**:
   - Jewelry-focused domain whitelist (GIA, American Gem Society, major retailers)
   - Safety guardrails blocking malicious keywords
   - Smart keyword detection (only searches jewelry-related queries)
   - Graceful timeout handling (8-second limit)
   - Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

2. **Modified `src/app.py`**:
   - Optional web search import with fallback capability
   - Search results prepended to user queries when relevant
   - Maintains original user input for memory logging
   - Zero impact on core functionality when API unavailable

3. **Production Safety Features**:
   - App starts successfully without TAVILY_API_KEY
   - All web search errors handled gracefully
   - No blocking API calls or dependencies
   - Render deployment compatible

### üîí Security Guardrails:
- **Domain Filtering**: Only trusted jewelry industry sources
- **Query Validation**: Blocks harmful/off-topic searches
- **Keyword Triggering**: Only jewelry-related queries trigger search
- **Timeout Protection**: 8-second limit prevents hanging
- **Error Isolation**: Web search failures don't crash app

### üß™ Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ App imports successfully without Tavily API key
- ‚úÖ App starts and serves requests normally
- ‚úÖ Health check returns 200 status
- ‚úÖ Protection system blocks main branch pushes
- ‚úÖ Web search branch deploys safely to GitHub

### üì¶ Deployment Requirements:
- **Environment Variable**: `TAVILY_API_KEY` (optional - app works without)
- **Dependencies**: `requests>=2.31.0` (already in requirements.txt)
- **Branch Protection**: All changes isolated on `web-search` branch

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Web search integration complete and production-ready

**Key Lessons**:
- Always implement graceful fallbacks for external APIs
- Use branch protection for safe feature development
- Security guardrails prevent misuse of web search
- Proper error handling maintains user experience

## [2025-06-03] Issue: URL Enhancement - Clickable Links and Verification

**Problem**: URLs in chat responses need to be:
1. Clickable and navigable by users
2. Properly spaced with line breaks above/below
3. Non-truncated (no cut-offs by screen)
4. Verified for accessibility by web search tool

**Solution**: Comprehensive URL handling system with verification and formatting:

### ‚úÖ Implementation Details:

1. **Enhanced `src/templates/widget.html`**:
   - **CSS Styling**: Added `.url-container`, `.msg.bot a` with proper styling
   - **Click Handling**: Links open in new tab with `target="_blank"`
   - **Responsive Design**: `word-wrap: break-word`, `overflow-wrap: anywhere`
   - **Visual Polish**: Hover effects, visited link colors, proper spacing
   - **Accessibility**: `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security

2. **Updated `formatChatResponse()` JavaScript Function**:
   - **URL Detection**: Regex patterns for `üîó` prefixed and standalone URLs
   - **Proper Wrapping**: URLs wrapped in `<div class="url-container">`
   - **Smart Spacing**: Prevents conflicts with paragraph/list formatting
   - **Visual Separation**: Border lines above/below URL containers

3. **Enhanced `src/tools/web_search_tool.py`**:
   - **URL Verification**: `verify_url()` function with HEAD requests
   - **Status Indicators**: ‚úÖ for accessible, ‚ö†Ô∏è for inaccessible URLs
   - **Batch Processing**: `verify_urls_in_response()` for complete responses
   - **Error Handling**: Timeout, connection, and request error management
   - **Performance**: 5-second timeout limit, HEAD requests only

4. **Updated `src/app.py`**:
   - **Automatic Verification**: URLs verified in all responses when web search enabled
   - **Graceful Fallback**: Verification skipped if web search unavailable
   - **Status Indicators**: Live verification results added to responses

### üé® URL Display Features:
- **Visual Styling**: Light blue clickable links with hover effects
- **Proper Spacing**: 12px margin above/below, 8px padding
- **No Cut-offs**: `word-break: break-all` prevents overflow
- **Status Indicators**: ‚úÖ verified, ‚ö†Ô∏è warning icons
- **Security**: External links open safely in new tabs

### üîç URL Verification Features:
- **Real-time Checking**: All URLs verified before display
- **Status Reporting**: Accessible vs inaccessible indication
- **Performance Optimized**: HEAD requests, 5-second timeouts
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of verification failures
- **Knowledge Base Protection**: Only trusted domains verified

### üß™ Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ URLs properly extracted from responses
- ‚úÖ Clickable links work correctly in widget
- ‚úÖ Proper spacing and no text cut-offs
- ‚úÖ Verification system working with status indicators
- ‚úÖ App functions normally with enhanced URL handling

### üì± User Experience Improvements:
- **One-Click Navigation**: Direct access to Diamond Family resources
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of link accessibility
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design prevents cut-offs
- **Professional Appearance**: Consistent styling with chat theme

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - URL enhancement complete with full verification

**Key Lessons**:
- CSS word-wrapping prevents URL cut-offs effectively
- Real-time URL verification improves user trust
- Visual indicators help users understand link status
- Proper spacing improves readability and user experience

## [Jan 3, 2025] Issue: Need flexible URL sharing approach vs rigid conditional logic

**Problem**: Original codebase had very rigid conditional logic around knowledge base URLs with complex multi-layered intent matching and programmatic URL injection through memory_manager.

**Root Cause**: 
- Complex conditional URL matching in `memory_manager.py` with multiple fallback layers
- Rigid intent-based URL injection that didn't leverage AI's natural reasoning
- Overly structured approach that limited AI's ability to contextually suggest relevant links

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Removed**: `memory_manager.inject_relevant_url()` programmatic injection
- **Removed**: Rigid conditional logic and intent matching layers  
- **Added**: URL reference directly in system prompt for AI cognition
- **Added**: Natural language instructions for contextual link sharing
- **Approach**: Trust AI to decide when/how to include relevant URLs based on conversation context

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before: Rigid programmatic injection
reply = memory_manager.inject_relevant_url(req.user_input, reply)

# After: AI cognition-based approach in system prompt
URL_REFERENCE = {
    "website_urls": {
        "main_site": "https://www.thediamondfamily.com/",
        "diamonds": "https://www.thediamondfamily.com/diamonds/",
        # ... etc
    }
}
# URLs provided to AI with natural usage instructions
```

**Testing Strategy**:
- Created `open-logic` branch for flexible approach testing
- Maintains web search functionality while simplifying URL logic  
- Allows comparison between structured (main) vs flexible (open-logic) approaches

**Expected Benefits**:
- More natural URL inclusion based on conversation flow
- Reduced complexity in codebase 
- Better contextual relevance of shared links
- AI can include multiple relevant links when appropriate

**Monitoring**: 
- Compare URL relevance and user engagement between branches
- Assess if AI naturally includes appropriate links without programmatic forcing
- Evaluate conversation flow and link utility

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - URL enhancement complete with full verification
